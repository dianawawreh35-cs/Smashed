# Decision log

Decisions that shaped the repository, newest first. Each entry records what was
chosen and why, so a later reader does not have to re-derive it.

### Decisions made while scaffolding

**Central package management.** All NuGet versions live in
`Directory.Packages.props`; project files reference packages without versions.
One place to audit and bump, and the server and agent app cannot silently drift
onto different EF Core versions.

**Agent app targets `net8.0-windows10.0.17763.0`, not `net8.0-windows`.**
`SIPSorceryMedia.Windows` ships only a `net8.0-windows10.0.17763` asset, so the
default `net8.0-windows7.0` moniker fails to restore. Windows 10 1809 is
therefore the minimum supported client OS for the agent desktop.

Two floors stack here, and SIPSorcery is the smaller one: .NET 8 itself does not
support Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 — its oldest supported client is Windows 10
1607 — and SIPSorceryMedia.Windows raises that to 1809. **The agent laptops run
Windows 11**, so neither floor is a practical constraint; `app.manifest`
declares Windows 10/11 compatibility only. Nothing older than Windows 10 1809 is
reachable without abandoning .NET 8 for the agent app, which is not on the table.

**SIPSorcery pinned to 8.0.23, SIPSorceryMedia.Windows to 8.0.14.** These are
the newest releases of each that still target .NET 8 — SIPSorcery 10.x and
SIPSorceryMedia.Windows 10.x are `net10.0` only. **Known issue:** NuGet reports
two high-severity advisories against SIPSorcery 8.x
([GHSA-28gm-jrmw-xx93](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-28gm-jrmw-xx93),
[GHSA-jwjp-4649-v8jp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jwjp-4649-v8jp)) that
are fixed only in the 10.x line. Restore surfaces them as `NU1903` warnings, not
errors. Resolving this means moving the agent app to .NET 10, which is a stack
change outside this scaffold — it needs an explicit decision before the SIP
work begins.

**FluentAssertions pinned to 6.12.2.** Version 7 and later require a paid
commercial licence; 6.x remains Apache-2.0.

**`/health` needs no database.** The health check is liveness only, so the API
starts and answers `/health` with PostgreSQL down, and the server smoke test
runs in CI without a database service. A readiness check that verifies the
connection is added with the entity work.

**The SPA is served by the API in production, proxied in development.** The
Docker build compiles the web app with Node 20 and copies `dist/` into the
server's `wwwroot`; `MapFallbackToFile("index.html")` makes client-side routing
survive a refresh. In development Vite proxies `/api`, `/hubs`, `/health` and
`/swagger` to `http://localhost:5000`, so the API base URL is relative (`/api`)
in both environments and CORS is only configured for the Development
environment. Note that `wwwroot` must exist when the host starts or static file
serving is silently disabled — hence the tracked `.gitkeep`.

**API runs with `network_mode: host` in production.** SIP signalling and the RTP
media path do not survive Docker's NAT, and the AMI connection needs to reach
the PBX directly. PostgreSQL is bound to `127.0.0.1:5432` so it is never exposed
on the LAN.

**`Asia/Hebron` is set on every container.** Shift boundaries, daily reports and
retention windows are all local-time concepts; leaving containers on UTC would
silently shift report day boundaries.

**Arabic is the default language, right-to-left.** `index.html` ships
`lang="ar" dir="rtl"`, the WPF shell sets `FlowDirection="RightToLeft"`, and the
language switcher flips both the i18next language and `document.documentElement.dir`.
English is the secondary language, not the fallback default.

**CI builds the .NET solution on `windows-latest`.** The WPF agent app cannot be
built on Linux; the web job and the Docker image job run on `ubuntu-latest`.

**Phone numbers are stored as E.164 without the leading `+`.** `PhoneNormalizer`
folds every dialled form — `05x…`, `+970…`, `00970…`, Arabic-Indic digits,
separators — to one canonical string, and `Last9()` gives the fuzzy match key
used to find a contact from caller ID. Israeli (`972`) numbers are recognised
and deliberately passed through unchanged rather than rewritten, and numbers of
five digits or fewer are treated as internal extensions and never given a
country code.

**Enum string values are PascalCase, matching the schema exactly.** The CHECK
constraints in `SCHEMA.md` store `'Call'`, `'In'`, `'AgentApp'`, `'AMI'` and so
on, not lowercase or snake_case. `EnumStrings.ToDbValue()` maps each member
explicitly rather than relying on `ToString()`, because the acronym members
(`Ami`, `Cdr`, `Sip`) must serialise as `AMI`, `CDR`, `SIP`. Parsing is
case-insensitive but rejects numeric input, so a corrupt column value fails
loudly instead of silently becoming the member with that ordinal.
`EnumStringsTests` locks all eight sets against the schema.

> **`CallCenter.Shared.TaskStatus` shadows `System.Threading.Tasks.TaskStatus`**,
> which implicit usings bring into scope. Outside the `CallCenter.Shared`
> namespace it must be qualified or aliased. The name was kept because it is the
> name the schema and the prompts use.

### Reconciled against the SRS (2026-09-14)

All three source documents are now in `docs/`. What they confirmed or corrected:

**There is no `Admin` application role, and that is correct.** SRS §2.2 lists a
third role, *Administrator (technical)* — but its permissions are "server
settings, backups, updates", and it "may be the same person as the supervisor or
the developer". It is an operator of the box, not a user of the software, which
is why `users.role` is constrained to `('Agent','Supervisor')`. Do not add an
Admin role to the schema on the strength of §2.2.

**`PhoneNormalizer` is validated by A-13**, which requires numbers to match
"regardless of format (05…, +9705…, 02…, 972…)" — the exact four forms the
normaliser folds, including passing `972` through unchanged.

**Windows 10/11 is the contracted platform** (N-10), so the
`net8.0-windows10.0.17763.0` floor is inside the agreed scope. Five agents on
four shared laptops (§2.4), so the app must support agent switching (A-05).

**Arabic RTL + English is contractual** (A-80, N-09), for *both* applications —
not a preference. The SPA and the WPF shell already default to Arabic.

**Capacity target is ~500 communications/day, reports under 5 s over one year**
(N-02), 5 agents scaling to 20 (N-03). That is small — roughly 180k rows a year.
The indexes in `SCHEMA.md` are comfortably sufficient; no partitioning needed.

**The PBX is an Issabel (Asterisk) system hosted by an external telephony
provider and reached over a VPN, and AMI is TCP 5038** (S-50). Issabel enables
AMI by default, but the provider must create a user for us and permit the
server's VPN address, so availability stays an explicit client dependency
(§12.3): if the provider will not grant it, S-55 (CDR
import) and S-56 (call-back extension) replace it and the real-time requirement
is waived. The `Workers/` folder must therefore support both paths, and
`settings.pbx.ami.enabled` exists for exactly this.

### Docker image verified (2026-09-14)

`docker build -f src/CallCenter.Server/Dockerfile -t callcenter-api:latest .`
builds clean and the container was smoke-tested: `/health` returns 200
`Healthy`, `/` and `/dashboard` return 200 from the SPA baked into `wwwroot`
(so the Node stage and the copy into the publish output both work), the
container `HEALTHCHECK` reports `healthy`, and `date` inside the container is
EEST — `Asia/Hebron` is applied. Image size 344 MB.

Docker Desktop on Windows needs WSL 2: `wslEngineEnabled` is true by default and
the engine will not start without it (`wsl --install --no-distribution`, then
reboot).

### Discrepancies to resolve

- ~~**Assembly name.**~~ **Resolved: the project stays `CallCenter.Server`, and
  the runbook was corrected to match.** Renaming would touch the csproj,
  namespaces, the solution, the Dockerfile, CI, the published image and the
  deployment scripts; the runbook was one word. `Server` is also the SRS's own
  term for this component (§2.1, "Server (mini PC, LAN)"), of which the API is
  one of three jobs.
- ~~**The seed command does not exist yet.**~~ **Resolved:**
  `dotnet CallCenter.Server.dll seed` creates the §7 data and the first
  supervisor. Every step is idempotent, and it refuses to create a supervisor
  once any user exists — it is an installation command, not a way to mint an
  account on a running system.
- ~~**Migrations are not applied on startup.**~~ **Resolved:**
  `DatabaseInitialiser` applies pending migrations before the host serves, which
  is what step 6 of the runbook has always claimed. `Database:MigrateOnStartup=false`
  turns it off for a site that would rather run them by hand. Fine for one
  server; if a second API instance is ever added, two could migrate at once and
  this should move behind a PostgreSQL advisory lock.
- **`/downloads/AgentApp-Setup.exe`.** Runbook step 10 installs the agent app
  from the server; A-82/N-11 require updates to be served the same way. The API
  needs a downloads endpoint and the build needs an installer — neither is
  scaffolded.
- **Ports 80 and 5001.** Resolved: the 5001 rule is dropped, since nothing ever
  listened there. The API now also binds port 80 so the supervisor reaches the
  dashboard by typing the server address with no port number; the SPA's
  catch-all route already redirects `/` to `/dashboard`. 5000 stays bound for
  the container healthcheck. This is plain HTTP on the LAN, which is acceptable
  while the system is not reachable from outside the restaurant. Exposing it to
  the internet would need a domain name and TLS on 443 behind a reverse proxy,
  and the authentication guards that App.tsx still marks as placeholders.

### Open items

- The SIPSorcery advisory above needs a decision: accept the risk on 8.x, or
  move the agent app to .NET 10.
- `contact_phones.last9` is a stored generated column (`right(normalised, 9)`).
  EF Core 8 must map it as computed/read-only (`ValueGeneratedOnAddOrUpdate`),
  and the `pgcrypto` extension plus the GIN index on
  `to_tsvector(name || address)` need explicit migration handling — none of
  these are scaffolded by convention.
- **This repository contains commercial terms.** SRS §12 carries pricing, the
  payment schedule and signature blocks. Keep the repository private, or strip
  §12 before making it public.
- SRS §10 lists three [TBC] items the client must answer before installation:
  whether the provider grants AMI and whether incoming routing is a queue or a ring
  group; the exact channel and classification-type lists; and whether
  supervisors get live agent status and call monitoring (not included by
  default).

## 2026-09-16 — The PBX moves to a hosted Issabel reached over a VPN

### What changed

The telephony platform is no longer a Yeastar S20 sitting on the restaurant LAN.
It is an **Issabel (Asterisk) system operated by an external telephony provider**,
reached over a **VPN**. Each agent laptop runs its own VPN client. The server —
database, recordings, API, supervisor app — stays on the mini PC at the
restaurant, unchanged.

### Why it matters beyond a name change

Three statements in the SRS were false as written and were corrected rather than
patched:

- **N-01** promised no internet dependency. Now split honestly: everything that
  is not telephony (call log, contacts, classification, app orders, reports)
  still works with no internet at all; calls do not, because the PBX is across
  it.
- **2.4** assumed laptops, server and PBX shared a LAN. Only the laptops and the
  server do now.
- **2.4** assumed no internet was needed for daily operation. It is, for calls.

**N-04** still holds — the phone does not depend on our server — but it now
depends on the VPN and the provider, neither of which the developer controls.
The agreed uptime and support hours for those are the client's arrangement with
the provider, and provider outages are excluded from support (§12).

Added **N-04a**: the app must say *which* part is missing — VPN down, not
registered, or server unreachable. With a remote PBX, "the phone doesn't work"
has more possible causes, and an agent needs to know whether to call IT or the
provider.

### Call recording — unchanged, and deliberately so

Issabel can record calls itself (per extension, queue or route; files under
`/var/spool/asterisk/monitor`, named in `asteriskcdrdb.cdr.recordingfile`) and
that was considered. **Rejected for now:** recording stays in the Agent App with
upload to our server (A-30 to A-33). Server-side recording would have removed
real complexity from the app and given cleaner audio, but it puts the audio on
the provider's disk, hands them control of the 90-day retention that S-43 gives
the supervisor, and makes the call-to-recording link a matching problem rather
than a guaranteed key. Worth revisiting if the app-side recording proves
troublesome over the VPN.

### Settings key renamed

`pbx.ip` becomes `pbx.host`: it is now the PBX's address on the VPN, not an IP
on the restaurant LAN. Changed in the seeder, `AuthService`, the schema document
and the tests. `PBX_IP` in `.env.example` becomes `PBX_HOST` with the same
reasoning.

### Deferred — the abandoned-call capture (SRS 4.5)

**Decision deferred on 2026-09-16.** Section 4.5, and with it **R-20** and
**R-21**, is on hold until the telephony provider answers §12.3. Deferred, not
dropped — the requirements stand as written and are the starting point once the
answers arrive. Runbook step 8 is marked skip-for-now.

The thing most likely to be missed: **4.5 needs the server to have its own VPN
connection**, because the server talks to the PBX directly over AMI or CDR. The
VPN on the agent laptops does nothing for it. If the provider will not give the
server VPN access, 4.5 and those two reports cannot be delivered at all — so
that question is worth asking early even though the work is deferred.

Issabel itself is not the obstacle: AMI is part of Asterisk and Issabel enables
it by default on TCP 5038, and the CDR lives in the `cdr` table of
`asteriskcdrdb`. What is unknown is what the *provider* will grant.
